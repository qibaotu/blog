There are many tutorials regarding how to build a blog using Rblogdown+Hugo+Github+Netlify,yet none of them worked for me, except [this one](https://www.weibinqu.xyz/cn/2018/03/set-your-blog-by-blogdown/). I followed exactly and finally succeeded.

That is just one reason I want to have a blog: although we can easily get lots of information from the web, to find the one work for us is not easy.
