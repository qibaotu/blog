Most of the time,I can find the solution to a specific questions via google. But sometimes I also feel a need to systematically learn the basic ideas of a disciepline. This note summarizes the resources good and useful to me.

1. [Statistical Analysis of Genomics Data](https://newonlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat555/). Online course provided by PennState University. Comprehensive and easy to understand.
2. [bio-info-trainee](http://www.bio-info-trainee.com/). A website established by Binformatics students(?) in China. kind of forum, many step-by-step tutorials and homeworks. Also comprehensive.
